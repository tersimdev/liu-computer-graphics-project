Note: These models are preliminary. Sizes and orientations can be wrong. I will fix this but have not have time yet.

Two houses by Susanne:
======================

house3
2023

Both have textures that I have verified to fit when loaded with my units.

These were made in Blender and are very much off in size.
Both come in "scaled" versions that look more right.

A few models by me, in the folder "preliminary":
================================================

These models were made in TinkerCAD, and have issues with normal vectors. No textures.

boxhouse
Super simple house

house
house-multi
A plain house with window openings and door. The "multi" version is a multi-part OBJ so you can extract the part as separate models and render them with different textures or colors.

house2
house2-multi
A somewhat more elaborate house, also with a "multi" version.

rocket
That stupid rocket that I slapped together on the lecture. It is junk, but...

simple-house
Same as boxhouse. Right now I don't remember which was best so I throw in both.

tree-m-small
A super silly little "tree", multiple parts so the trunk and the "leaves" can be colored differently.

Textures
========

I have included some new textures that should be enough for the lab:
bark2
bricks
